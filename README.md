Text Analysis Program v2

This is a Kotlin/Java developer test task solution. The program analyzes the text file Moby Dick from the provided URL and produces word statistics after filtering out stopwords (prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, articles, and modal verbs).

üìå Features

Total Word Count (after filtering stopwords).

Top 5 Most Frequent Words with their counts.

Top 50 Unique Words in alphabetical order.

Case Insensitive Processing (e.g., Hello, hello, HELLO are treated the same).

Exclusions Applied:

Prepositions (e.g., in, on, at)

Pronouns (e.g., he, she, it)

Conjunctions (e.g., and, or, but)

Articles (e.g., the, a, an)

Modal verbs (is, was, etc.)

Possessive postfix ('s)

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Reads the text directly from the URL:
moby.txt

Normalizes the text to lowercase.

Splits into words using regex (\\W+) ‚Üí only letters are considered.

Filters out stopwords and possessive postfixes.

Counts word frequencies using a HashMap.

Extracts:
